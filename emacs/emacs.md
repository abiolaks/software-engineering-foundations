..okay.. there we go..with Some History of Emacs.

## What is GNU Emacs.

Emacs is one of the oldest linux text editors available, but is popularity grew for the powerful features and abilities it offers for text manipulation and editing. The real true super power of emacs is it offer so much more!.

From the software page [GNU emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable free/libre text editor and more. It is a cross platform text editor as such it is portable across operating system.

## Undertanding the term - TEXT EDITOR
A text editor is essentially a word processor. In the early days, text editor was a command that could generate words and dump them into a file, or find and replace words in a file, or remove lines from a line.

## The Birth of Emacs
Editing then can be tedious particularly when editing large files and document and as result macros was developed to perform related  task.

Then in 1983, Richard Stallman release a bundle of his macro under the name editing macros, or "EMACS" for short- This is the birth of world most powerful editor. An emacs became one of the most successful applications of GNU project by Dr. Stallman.

Macros are series of commands and instruction that you group together as a single command to accomplish a task automatically.Macros are used to make a sequence of computing instruction available to programmer as a single program statement, making the programming task less tedious and less error-prone- they are called macro because a big block of code can be expanded from small sequence of characters. More on macro [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)),[more macros](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3833/macro).

Emacs is highly customizable as everything inside of it can be changed and molded into a form suitable to the programmer desire.

Emacs is so self containing - I will say "it is one ring to rule them all". you can use shell inside emacs, you can edit document, it also come with a file manager, you can acess email and web ...just name it. I love emacs.

However as the saying goes "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"Emacs offers so much and as result it just require you to spend some time with it to reap and enjoy it super powers. Also, the fact that it an old editor and use key binding; hitting the ctrl key and meta key and many  more
