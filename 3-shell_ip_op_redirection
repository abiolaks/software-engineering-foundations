# Understanding Shell Input and Ouput Redirection

__I/O redirection is a command line feature that enables the us to redirect the input and or the ouput of command from and/or to files or chain multiples commands together.

In linux there are 3 default files for input and ouput;

* stdin or 0 - it is connected to the keyboard, most program read input from this file

* stdout or 1 - it's ouput to the screen

* stderr or 2 - this send status and error messages are sent to this file and it is outputed to the screen.

I/O redirections allows you to alter the input source of a command as well as where it's output and error messages are sent to. This is make possible by the "<" and ">".

## Standard Output
Most command line program send their results in a facility called the stdout. i.e on the screen. standard output directs its content to the display(screen). 

However the stdout results can be redirect to files, program and devices.

The ">" symbol redirect the results of stdout to a what is specify after the symbol

    ls > file_name
The result of the ls is now send to the specify file name.

## Standard Input
The standard input get its content from the keyboard. we can as well get input from sources beside the keyboard input like files, the output of a command etc.

    sort < file_name
sort command got it input from the file name.

Using the "<" symbol allow  this to be possible.


## Pipelines

Pipelines enables the chaining on two or more commands. it allows us to combine multiple commands together. 

The "|" makes this possible.

    ls -l | less
This use two command line program, ls and the less command
